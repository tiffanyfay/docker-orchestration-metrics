Docker <br/> Orchestration <br/> & Metrics
## [@tiffanyfayj](https://twitter.com/tiffanyfayj)

---

## Getting the application source code

- We will clone the GitHub repository

- The repository also contains scripts and tools that we will use

.exercise[

<!--
```bash
[ -d orchestration-workshop ] && mv orchestration-workshop orchestration-workshop.$$
```
-->

- Clone the repository on `node1`:
  ```bash
  git clone git://github.com/jpetazzo/orchestration-workshop
  ```

#  Swarm

---

# SwarmKit

- [SwarmKit](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit) is an open source
  toolkit to build multi-node systems

- It is a reusable library, like libcontainer, libnetwork, vpnkit ...

- It is a plumbing part of the Docker ecosystem

- SwarmKit comes with two examples:

  - `swarmctl` (a CLI tool to "speak" the SwarmKit API)

  - `swarmd` (an agent that can federate existing Docker Engines into a Swarm)

- SwarmKit/swarmd/swarmctl → libcontainer/containerd/container-ctr

---

## SwarmKit concepts (1/2)

- A *cluster* will be at least one *node* (preferably more)

- A *node* can be a *manager* or a *worker*

  (Note: in SwarmKit, *managers* are also *workers*)

- A *manager* actively takes part in the Raft consensus

- You can talk to a *manager* using the SwarmKit API

- One *manager* is elected as the *leader*; other managers merely forward requests to it

---

## Illustration

![Illustration](swarm-mode.svg)

---

## SwarmKit concepts (2/2)

- The *managers* expose the SwarmKit API

- Using the API, you can indicate that you want to run a *service*

- A *service* is specified by its *desired state*: which image, how many instances...

- The *leader* uses different subsystems to break down services into *tasks*:
  <br/>orchestrator, scheduler, allocator, dispatcher

- A *task* corresponds to a specific container, assigned to a specific *node*

- *Nodes* know which *tasks* should be running, and will start or stop containers accordingly (through the Docker Engine API)

You can refer to the [NOMENCLATURE](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/blob/master/design/nomenclature.md) in the SwarmKit repo for more details.

---

## Swarm Mode

- Since version 1.12, Docker Engine embeds SwarmKit

- The Docker CLI features three new commands:

  - `docker swarm` (enable Swarm mode; join a Swarm; adjust cluster parameters)

  - `docker node` (view nodes; promote/demote managers; manage nmodes)

  - `docker service` (create and manage services)

- The Docker API exposes the same concepts

- The SwarmKit API is also exposed (on a separate socket)

---

## You need to enable Swarm mode to use the new stuff

- By default, all this new code is inactive

- Swarm Mode can be enabled, "unlocking" SwarmKit functions
  <br/>(services, out-of-the-box overlay networks, etc.)

.exercise[

- Try a Swarm-specific command:
  ```bash
  docker node ls
  ```

]

You will get an error message:
```
Error response from daemon: This node is not a swarm manager. [...]
```

---

# Creating our first Swarm

- The cluster is initialized with `docker swarm init`

- This should be executed on a first, seed node

- .warning[DO NOT execute `docker swarm init` on multiple nodes!]

  You would have multiple disjoint clusters.

.exercise[

- Create our cluster from node1:
  ```bash
  docker swarm init
  ```

]

---

## Token generation

- In the output of `docker swarm init`, we have a message
  confirming that our node is now the (single) manager:

  ```
  Swarm initialized: current node (8jud...) is now a manager.
  ```

- Docker generated two security tokens (like passphrases or passwords) for our cluster

- The CLI shows us the command to use on other nodes to add them to the cluster using the "worker"
  security token:

  ```
    To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:
      docker swarm join \
      --token SWMTKN-1-59fl4ak4nqjmao1ofttrc4eprhrola2l87... \
      172.31.4.182:2377
  ```

---

## Checking that Swarm mode is enabled

.exercise[

- Run the traditional `docker info` command:
  ```bash
  docker info
  ```

]

The output should include:

```
Swarm: active
 NodeID: 8jud7o8dax3zxbags3f8yox4b
 Is Manager: true
 ClusterID: 2vcw2oa9rjps3a24m91xhvv0c
 ...
```

---

## Running our first Swarm mode command

- Let's retry the exact same command as earlier

.exercise[

- List the nodes (well, the only node) of our cluster:
  ```bash
  docker node ls
  ```

]

The output should look like the following:
```
ID             HOSTNAME  STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
8jud...ox4b *  node1     Ready   Active        Leader
```

---

## Adding nodes to the Swarm

.exercise[

- Add nodes 2 and 3 as workers
   ```bash
  TOKEN=$(docker swarm join-token -q worker)
  for N in 2 3; do
      ssh node$N docker swarm join --token $TOKEN node1:2377
  done
  ```

]

---

## Adding more manager nodes

- Right now, we have only one manager (node1)

- If we lose it, we're SOL

- Let's make our cluster highly available

.exercise[

- Get the manager token and use it to add nodes 4 and 5 to the cluster:
  ```bash
    TOKEN=$(docker swarm join-token -q manager)
    for N in 4 5; do
      ssh node$N docker swarm join --token $TOKEN node1:2377
    done
  ```

]

---

## You can control the Swarm from any manager node

.exercise[

- Try the following command on a few different nodes:
  ```bash
  ssh nodeX docker node ls
  ```

]

On manager nodes:
<br/>you will see the list of nodes, with a `*` denoting
the node you're talking to.

On non-manager nodes:
<br/>you will get an error message telling you that
the node is not a manager.

As we saw earlier, you can only control the Swarm through a manager node.

---

## Promoting nodes

- Instead of adding a manager node, we can also promote existing workers

- Nodes can be promoted (and demoted) at any time

.exercise[

- See the current list of nodes:
  ```
  docker node ls
  ```

- Promote the two worker nodes to be managers:
  ```
  docker node promote XXX YYY
  ```

]

---

## How many managers to we need?

- 2N+1 nodes can (and will) tolerate N failures
  <br/>(you can have an even number of managers, but there is no point)

--

- 1 manager = no failure

- 3 managers = 1 failure

- 5 managers = 2 failures (or 1 failure during 1 maintenance)

- 7 managers and more = now you might be overdoing it a little bit

---

## Why not have *all* nodes be managers?

- Intuitively, it's harder to reach consensus in larger groups

- With Raft, each write needs to be acknowledged by the majority of nodes

- More nodes = more chance that we will have to wait for some laggard

- Bigger network = more latency

---

# Running our first Swarm service

- How do we run services? Simplified version:

  `docker run` → `docker service create`

.exercise[

- Create a service featuring Alpine containers pinging Google resolvers:
  ```bash
  docker service create --mode global alpine ping 8.8.8.8
  ```

]

#  Metrics

---

# Metrics collection

- We want to gather metrics in a central place

- We will gather node metrics and container metrics

- We want a nice interface to view them (graphs)

---

## Node metrics

- CPU, RAM, disk usage on the whole node

- Total number of processes running, and their states

- Number of open files, sockets, and their states

- I/O activity (disk, network), per operation or volume

- Physical/hardware (when applicable): temperature, fan speed ...

- ... and much more!

---

## Container metrics

- Similar to node metrics, but not totally identical

- RAM breakdown will be different

  - active vs inactive memory
  - some memory is *shared* between containers, and accounted specially

- I/O activity is also harder to track

  - async writes can cause deferred "charges"
  - some page-ins are also shared between containers

For details about container metrics, see:
<br/>
http://jpetazzo.github.io/2013/10/08/docker-containers-metrics/

---

## Tools

We will use three open source Go projects for our metrics pipeline:

- Intel Snap

  Collects, processes, and publishes metrics

- InfluxDB

  Stores metrics

- Grafana

  Displays metrics visually

---

## Snap

- [github.com/intelsdi-x/snap](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap)

- Can collect, process, and publish metric data

- Doesn’t store metrics

- Works as a daemon (snapd) controlled by a CLI (snapctl)

- Offloads collecting, processing, and publishing to plugins

- Does nothing out of the box; configuration required!

- Docs: https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/

---

## InfluxDB

- Snap doesn't store metrics data

- InfluxDB is specifically designed for time-series data

  - CRud vs. CRUD (you rarely if ever update/delete data)

  - orthogonal read and write patterns

- Snap has a plugin allowing to *publish* to InfluxDB

---

## Grafana

- Snap cannot show graphs

- InfluxDB cannot show graphs

- Grafana will take care of that

- Grafana can read data from InfluxDB and display it as graphs

---

## Getting and setting up Snap

- We will install Snap directly on the nodes

- Release tarballs are available from GitHub

- We will use a *global service*
  <br/>(started on all nodes, including nodes added later)

- This service will download and unpack Snap in /opt and /usr/local

- /opt and /usr/local will be bind-mounted from the host

- This service will effectively install Snap on the hosts

---

## The Snap installer service

- This will get Snap on all nodes

.exercise[

```bash
docker service create --restart-condition=none --mode global \
       --mount type=bind,source=/usr/local/bin,target=/usr/local/bin \
       --mount type=bind,source=/opt,target=/opt centos sh -c '
SNAPVER=v0.16.1-beta
RELEASEURL=https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/releases/download/$SNAPVER
curl -sSL $RELEASEURL/snap-$SNAPVER-linux-amd64.tar.gz |
     tar -C /opt -zxf-
curl -sSL $RELEASEURL/snap-plugins-$SNAPVER-linux-amd64.tar.gz |
     tar -C /opt -zxf-
ln -s snap-$SNAPVER /opt/snap
for BIN in snapd snapctl; do ln -s /opt/snap/bin/$BIN /usr/local/bin/$BIN; done
' If you copy-paste that block, do not forget that final quote ☺
```

]

---

## First contact with `snapd`

- The core of Snap is `snapd`, the Snap daemon

- Application made up of a REST API, control module, and scheduler module

.exercise[

- Start `snapd` with plugin trust disabled and log level set to debug:
  ```bash
  snapd -t 0 -l 1
  ```

]

- More resources:

  https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/snapd.md
  https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/snapteld_CONFIGURATION.md

---

## Using `snapctl` to interact with `snapd`

- Let's load a *collector* and a *publisher* plugins

.exercise[

- Open a new terminal

- Load the psutil collector plugin:
  ```bash
  snapctl plugin load /opt/snap/plugin/snap-plugin-collector-psutil
  ```

- Load the file publisher plugin:
  ```bash
  snapctl plugin load /opt/snap/plugin/snap-plugin-publisher-mock-file
  ```

]

---

## Checking what we've done

- Good to know: Docker CLI uses `ls`, Snap CLI uses `list`

.exercise[

- See your loaded plugins:
  ```bash
  snapctl plugin list
  ```

- See the metrics you can collect:
  ```bash
  snapctl metric list
  ```

]

---

## Actually collecting metrics: introducing *tasks*

- To start collecting/processing/publishing metric data, you need to create a *task*

- A *task* indicates:

  - *what* to collect (which metrics)
  - *when* to collect it (e.g. how often)
  - *how* to process it (e.g. use it directly, or compute moving averages)
  - *where* to publish it

- Tasks can be defined with manifests written in JSON or YAML

- Some plugins, such as the Docker collector, allow for wildcards (\*) in the metrics "path"
  <br/>(see snap/docker-influxdb.json)

- More resources:
  https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/TASKS.md

---

## Our first task manifest

```yaml
  version: 1
  schedule:
    type: "simple" # collect on a set interval
    interval: "1s" # of every 1s
  max-failures: 10
  workflow:
    collect: # first collect
      metrics: # metrics to collect
        /intel/psutil/load/load1: {}
      config: # there is no configuration
      publish: # after collecting, publish
        -
            plugin_name: "file" # use the file publisher
            config:
                file: "/tmp/snap-psutil-file.log" # write to this file
```

---

## Creating our first task

- The task manifest shown on the previous slide is stored in `snap/psutil-file.yml`.

.exercise[

- Create a task using the manifest:

  ```bash
  cd ~/orchestration-workshop/snap
  snapctl task create -t psutil-file.yml
  ```

]

  The output should look like the following:
  ```
    Using task manifest to create task
    Task created
    ID: 240435e8-a250-4782-80d0-6fff541facba
    Name: Task-240435e8-a250-4782-80d0-6fff541facba
    State: Running
  ```

---

## Checking existing tasks

.exercise[

- This will confirm that our task is running correctly, and remind us of its task ID

  ```bash
  snapctl task list
  ```

]

The output should look like the following:
  ```
    ID           NAME              STATE     HIT MISS FAIL CREATED
    24043...acba Task-24043...acba Running   4   0    0    2:34PM   8-13-2016
  ```
---

## Viewing our task dollars at work

- The task is using a very simple publisher, `mock-file`

- That publisher just writes text lines in a file (one line per data point)

.exercise[

- Check that the data is flowing indeed:
  ```bash
  tail -f /tmp/snap-psutil-file.log
  ```

]

To exit, hit `^C`

---

## Debugging tasks

- When a task is not directly writing to a local file, use `snapctl task watch`

- `snapctl task watch` will stream the metrics you are collecting to STDOUT

.exercise[

```bash
snapctl task watch <ID>
```

]

To exit, hit `^C`

---

## Stopping snap

- Our Snap deployment has a few flaws:

  - snapd was started manually

  - it is running on a single node

  - the configuration is purely local

--

- We want to change that!

--

- But first, go back to the terminal where `snapd` is running, and hit `^C`

- All tasks will be stopped; all plugins will be unloaded; Snap will exit

---

## Snap Tribe Mode

- Tribe is Snap's clustering mechanism

- When tribe mode is enabled, nodes can join *agreements*

- When a node in an *agreement* does something (e.g. load a plugin or run a task),
  <br/>other nodes of that agreement do the same thing

- We will use it to load the Docker collector and InfluxDB publisher on all nodes,
  <br/>and run a task to use them

- Without tribe mode, we would have to load plugins and run tasks manually on every node

- More resources:
  https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/TRIBE.md

---

## Running Snap itself on every node

.warning[Hackety hack ahead!]

- We will create a *global service*

- That global service will install a SSH client

- With that SSH client, the service will connect back to its local node
  <br/>(i.e. "break out" of the container, using the SSH key that we provide)

- Once logged on the node, the service starts snapd with Tribe Mode enabled

---

## Running Snap itself on every node

.exercise[

- Start Snap all over the place:
  ```bash
    docker service create --name snapd --mode global \
           --mount type=bind,source=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa,target=/sshkey \
           alpine sh -c "
                  apk add --no-cache openssh-client &&
                  ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i /sshkey docker@172.17.0.1 \
                      sudo snapd -t 0 -l 1 --tribe --tribe-seed node1:6000
           " # If you copy-paste that block, don't forget that final quote :-)
   ```

]

---

## Viewing the members of our tribe

- If everything went fine, Snap is now running in tribe mode

.exercise[

- View the members of our tribe:
  ```bash
  snapctl member list
  ```

]

This should show the 5 nodes with their hostnames.

---

## Create an agreement

- We can now create an *agreement* for our plugins and tasks

.exercise[

- Create an agreement; make sure to use the same name all along:
  ```bash
  snapctl agreement create docker-influxdb
  ```

]

The output should look like the following:

```
  Name             Number of Members       plugins      tasks
  docker-influxdb  0                       0            0
```

---

## Instruct all nodes to join the agreement

- We don't need another fancy global service!

- We can join nodes from any existing node of the cluster

.exercise[

- Add all nodes to the agreement:
  ```bash
    snapctl member list | tail -n +2 |
      xargs -n1 snapctl agreement join docker-influxdb
  ```

]

The last bit of output should look like the following:
```
  Name             Number of Members       plugins         tasks
  docker-influxdb  5                       0               0
```

---

## Running InfluxDB

- We will create a service for InfluxDB

- We will use the official image

- InfluxDB uses multiple ports:

  - 8086 (HTTP API; we need this)

  - 8083 (admin interface; we need this)

  - 8088 (cluster communication; not needed here)

  - more ports for other protocols (graphite, collectd...)

- We will just publish the first two

---

## Creating the InfluxDB service

.exercise[

- Start an InfluxDB service, publishing ports 8083 and 8086:
  ```bash
    docker service create --name influxdb \
           --publish 8083:8083 \
           --publish 8086:8086 \
           influxdb:0.13
  ```

]

Note: this will allow any node to publish metrics data to `localhost:8086`,
and it will allows us to access the admin interface by connecting to any node
on port 8083.

.warning[Make sure to use InfluxDB 0.13; a few things changed in 1.0
(like, the name of the default retention policy is now "autogen") and
this breaks a few things.]

---

## Setting up InfluxDB

- We need to create the "snap" database

.exercise[

- Connect to http://any.node.address:8083/

- Enter the following query in the query box:
  ```
  CREATE DATABASE "snap"
  ```

- In the top-right corner, select "Database: snap"

]

Note: the InfluxDB query language *looks like* SQL but it's not.

???

## Setting a retention policy

- When graduating to 1.0, InfluxDB changed the name of the default policy

- It used to be "default" and it is now "autogen"

- Snap still uses "default" and this results in errors

.exercise[

- Create a "default" retention policy by entering the following query in the box:
  ```
  CREATE RETENTION POLICY "default" ON "snap" DURATION 1w REPLICATION 1
  ```

]

---

## Load Docker collector and InfluxDB publisher

- We will load plugins on the local node

- Since our local node is a member of the agreement, all other
  nodes in the agreement will also load these plugins

.exercise[

- Load Docker collector:

  ```bash
  snapctl plugin load /opt/snap/plugin/snap-plugin-collector-docker
  ```

- Load InfluxDB publisher:

  ```bash
  snapctl plugin load /opt/snap/plugin/snap-plugin-publisher-influxdb
  ```

]

---

## Start a simple collection task

- Again, we will create a task on the local node

- The task will be replicated on other nodes members of the same agreement

.exercise[

- Load a task manifest file collecting a couple of metrics on all containers,
  <br/>and sending them to InfluxDB:
  ```bash
  snapctl task create -t docker-influxdb.json
  ```

]

Note: the task description sends metrics to the InfluxDB API endpoint
located at 127.0.0.1:8086. Since the InfluxDB container is published
on port 8086, 127.0.0.1:8086 always routes traffic to the InfluxDB
container.

---

## If things go wrong...

Note: if a task runs into a problem (e.g. it's trying to publish
to a metrics database, but the database is unreachable), the task
will be stopped.

You will have to restart it manually by running:

```bash
snapctl task enable <ID>
snapctl task start <ID>
```

This must be done *per node*. Alternatively, you can delete+re-create
the task (it will delete+re-create on all nodes).

## Check that metric data shows up in InfluxDB

- Let's check existing data with a few manual queries in the InfluxDB admin interface

.exercise[

- List "measurements":
  ```
  SHOW MEASUREMENTS
  ```
  (This should show two generic entries corresponding to the two collected metrics.)

- View time series data for one of the metrics:
  ```
  SELECT * FROM "intel/docker/stats/cgroups/cpu_stats/cpu_usage/total_usage"
  ```
  (This should show a list of data points with **time**, **docker_id**, **source**, and **value**.)

]

---

## Deploy Grafana

- We will use an almost-official image, `grafana/grafana`

- We will publish Grafana's web interface on its default port (3000)

.exercise[

- Create the Grafana service:
  ```bash
  docker service create --name grafana --publish 3000:3000 grafana/grafana:3.1.1
  ```

]

---

## Set up Grafana

.exercise[

- Go to http://any.node.address:3000/

- Identify with "admin" as the username and password

- Click on the Grafana logo (the orange spiral in the top left corner)

- Click on "Data Sources"

- Click on "Add data source" (green button on the right)

]

---

## Add InfluxDB as a data source for Grafana

.small[

Fill the form exactly as follows:
- Name = "snap"
- Type = "InfluxDB"

In HTTP settings, fill as follows:
- Url = "http://any.node.address:8086"
- Access = "direct"
- Leave HTTP Auth untouched

In InfluxDB details, fill as follows:
- Database = "snap"
- Leave user and password blank

Finally, click on "add", you should see a green message saying "Success - Data source is working".
If you see an orange box (sometimes without a message), it means that you got something wrong. Triple check everything again.

]

---

---

## Create a dashboard in Grafana

.exercise[

- Click on the Grafana logo again (the orange spiral in the top left corner)

- Hover over "Dashboards"

- Click "+ New"

- Click on the little green rectangle that appeared in the top left

- Hover over "Add Panel"

- Click on "Graph"

]

At this point, you should see a sample graph showing up.

---

## Setting up a graph in Grafana

.exercise[

- Panel data source: select snap
- Click on the SELECT metrics query to expand it
- Click on "select measurement" and pick CPU usage
- Click on the "+" right next to "WHERE"
- Select "docker_id"
- Select the ID of a container of your choice (e.g. the one running InfluxDB)
- Click on the "+" on the right of the "SELECT" line
- Add "derivative"
- In the "derivative" option, select "1s"
- In the top right corner, click on the clock, and pick "last 5 minutes"

]

---

## Prometheus

- Prometheus is another metrics collection system

- Snap *pushes* metrics; Prometheus *pulls* them

- The *Prometheus server* pulls, stores, and displays metrics

- Its configuration defines a list of *exporter* endpoints
  <br/>(that list can be dynamic, using e.g. Consul, DNS, Etcd...)

- The exporters expose metrics over HTTP using a simple line-oriented format

  (An optimized format using protobuf is also possible)

---

## It's all about the `/metrics`

- This is what the *node exporter* looks like:

  http://demo.robustperception.io:9100/metrics

- Prometheus itself exposes its own internal metrics, too:

  http://demo.robustperception.io:9090/metrics

- A *Prometheus server* will *scrape* URLs like these

  (It can also use protobuf to avoid the overhead of parsing line-oriented formats!)

---

## Collecting metrics with Prometheus on Swarm

- We will run two *global services* (i.e. scheduled on all our nodes):

  - the Prometheus *node exporter* to get node metrics

  - Google's cAdvisor to get container metrics

- We will run a Prometheus server to scrape these exporters

- The Prometheus server will be configured to use DNS service discovery

- We will use `tasks.<servicename>` for service discovery

- All these services will be placed on a private internal network

---

## Creating an overlay network for Prometheus

- This is the easiest step ☺

.exercise[

- Create an overlay network:
  ```bash
  docker network create --driver overlay prom
  ```

]

---

## Running the node exporter

- The node exporter *should* run directly on the hosts
- However, it can run from a container, if configured properly
  <br/>
  (it needs to access the host's filesystems, in particular /proc and /sys)

.exercise[

- Start the node exporter:
  ```bash
    docker service create --name node --mode global --network prom \
     --mount type=bind,source=/proc,target=/host/proc \
     --mount type=bind,source=/sys,target=/host/sys \
     --mount type=bind,source=/,target=/rootfs \
     prom/node-exporter \
      -collector.procfs /host/proc \
      -collector.sysfs /host/proc \
      -collector.filesystem.ignored-mount-points "^/(sys|proc|dev|host|etc)($|/)"
   ```

]

---

## Running cAdvisor

- Likewise, cAdvisor *should* run directly on the hosts

- But it can run in containers, if configured properly

.exercise[

- Start the cAdvisor collector:
  ```bash
    docker service create --name cadvisor --network prom --mode global \
      --mount type=bind,source=/,target=/rootfs \
      --mount type=bind,source=/var/run,target=/var/run \
      --mount type=bind,source=/sys,target=/sys \
      --mount type=bind,source=/var/lib/docker,target=/var/lib/docker \
      google/cadvisor:latest
  ```

]

---

## Configuring the Prometheus server

This will be our configuration file for Prometheus:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 1s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'node'
    dns_sd_configs:
      - names: ['tasks.node']
        type: 'A'
        port: 9100
  - job_name: 'cadvisor'
    dns_sd_configs:
      - names: ['tasks.cadvisor']
        type: 'A'
        port: 8080
```

---

## Passing the configuration to the Prometheus server

- We need to provide our custom configuration to the Prometheus server

- The easiest solution is to create a custom image bundling this configuration

- We will use a very simple Dockerfile:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM prom/prometheus:v1.4.1
  COPY prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
  ```

  (The configuration file, and the Dockerfile, are in the `prom` subdirectory)

- We will build this image, and push it to our local registry

- Then we will create a service using this image

---

## Building our custom Prometheus image

- We will use the local registry started previously on localhost:5000

.exercise[

- Build the image using the provided Dockerfile:
  ```bash
  docker build -t localhost:5000/prometheus ~/orchestration-workshop/prom
  ```
- Create the registry service:
  ```bash
  docker service create --name registry --publish 5000:5000 registry:2
  ```

- Push the image to our local registry:
  ```bash
  docker push localhost:5000/prometheus
  ```

]

---

## Running our custom Prometheus image

- That's the only service that needs to be published

  (If we want to access Prometheus from outside!)

.exercise[

- Start the Prometheus server:
  ```bash
    docker service create --network prom --name prom \
           --publish 9090:9090 localhost:5000/prometheus
  ```

]

---

## Checking our Prometheus server

- First, let's make sure that Prometheus is correctly scraping all metrics

.exercise[

- Connect to `http://<any.node.address>:9090`

- Click on "status", then "targets"

]

You should see 11 endpoints (5 cadvisor, 5 node, 1 prometheus).

Their state should be "UP".

---

## Displaying metrics directly from Prometheus

- This is easy ... if you are familiar with PromQL

.exercise[

- Click on "Graph", and in "expression", paste the following:
  ```
    sum without (cpu) (
      irate(
        container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{
          container_label_com_docker_swarm_service_name="influxdb"
          }[1m]
      )
    )
  ```

- Click on the blue "Execute" button and on the "Graph" tab just below

]

---

## Comparing Snap and Prometheus data

- If you haven't setup Snap, InfluxDB, and Grafana, skip this section

- If you have closed the Grafana tab, you might have to re-setup a new dashboard

  (Unless you saved it before navigating it away)

- To re-do the setup, just follow again the instructions from the previous chapter

---

## Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana

.exercise[

- In a new tab, connect to Grafana (port 3000)

- Click on the Grafana logo (the orange spiral in the top-left corner)

- Click on "Data Sources"

- Click on the green "Add data source" button

]

We see the same input form that we filled earlier to connect to InfluxDB.

---

## Connecting to Prometheus from Grafana

.exercise[

- Enter "prom" in the name field

- Select "Prometheus" as the source type

- Enter http://(node IP address):9090 in the Url field

- Select "direct" as the access method

- Click on "Save and test"

]

Again, we should see a green box telling us "Data source is working."

Otherwise, double-check every field and try again!

---

## Adding the Prometheus data to our dashboard

.exercise[

- Go back to the the tab where we had our first Grafana dashboard

- Click on the blue "Add row" button in the lower right corner

- Click on the green tab on the left; select "Add panel" and "Graph"

]

This takes us to the graph editor that we used earlier.

---

## Querying Prometheus data from Grafana

The editor is a bit less friendly than the one we used for InfluxDB.

.exercise[

- Select "prom" as Panel data source

- Paste the query in the query field:
  ```
    sum without (cpu, id) ( irate (
      container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{
        container_label_com_docker_swarm_service_name="influxdb"}[1m] ) )
  ```

- Click outside of the query field to confirm

- Close the row editor by clicking the "X" in the top right area

]

---

## Interpreting results

- The two graphs *should* be similar

- Protip: align the time references!

.exercise[

- Click on the clock in the top right corner

- Select "last 30 minutes"

- Click on "Zoom out"

- Now press the right arrow key (hold it down and watch the CPU usage increase!)

]

*Adjusting units is left as an exercise for the reader.*
